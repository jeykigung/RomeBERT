## Usage

### RomeBERT - SD only

Scripts are in the `scripts` folder, which corresponds to `RomeBERT - SD only`. 


#### train_high.sh

This is for fine-tuning `RomeBERT - SD only` models.

#### eval_high_layer.sh

This is for evaluating each exit layer for fine-tuned `RomeBERT - SD only` models.

#### eval_high_entropy.sh

This is for evaluating fine-tuned `RomeBERT - SD only` models, given a number of different early exit entropy thresholds.

#### test_sd.sh

This is for creating output tsv file for test split for fine-tuned `RomeBERT - SD only` models.



### RomeBERT - SD + GR

Scripts are in the `new_scripts` folder, which corresponds to `RomeBERT - SD+GR`. 


#### train_high.sh

This is for fine-tuning `RomeBERT - SD+GR` models.

#### eval_high_layer.sh

This is for evaluating each exit layer for fine-tuned `RomeBERT - SD+GR` models.

#### eval_high_entropy.sh

This is for evaluating fine-tuned `RomeBERT - SD+GR` models, given a number of different early exit entropy thresholds.

#### test_sd+gr.sh

This is for creating output tsv file for test split for fine-tuned `RomeBERT - SD+GR` models.
